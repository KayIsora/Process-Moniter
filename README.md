# Process-Monitor
# I. Overview
The system is designed to monitor hardware/software resources (CPU, memory, I/O, network) on an embedded Linux board. A remote CLI client can send commands such as START, STOP, EDIT, SHOW, DELETE... via a socket, and the system will respond with real-time monitoring data.
